# aws-terraform
This repo contains code to automate AWS infrastructure

The code included in the above repository is used to create a VPC, public subnet and launch an ec2 instance in the selected region. All the variables are moved to seperate file "variables.tf", if you want to use this code with different values, please update the file and use it. 

Use the below commands to run the code:

1) terraform init
2) terraform apply #to run the code
3) terraform destroy #to delete the stack

Please reach out to me on udaymargadi@gmail.com on implementing the above code.
